<P>The goal is to create a schedule for all flights that arrive at the airport in such a way
	that the standard deviation (presented in the solution information block on the left) is as small
	as possible. The idea is that the smaller the deviation, the more equal all separation times between 
consecutive aircraft are, yielding a more robust solution against small deviations.</p>

<p>
Initially, all flights will be in the unassigned flights list on the bottom. By
right-clicking on a flight, you get a context menu which allows you to move the
flight from the unassigned list to the assigned list. Similarly, if a flight is
already assigned, you can right-click on the flight and from the context menu
select the option to unassign it again.</p>

<p>If two flights share the same gate at the same time, both flights will be 
colored red to indicate the conflict that needs to be resolved by the planner.</p>

<p>Because flights can only be moved within each of the two gantt charts, and
not from one to the other (i.e. move a flight from unassigned to assigned by
dragging it from the unassigned list to the assigned list), the options to either
move all flights at once from the unassigned list to the assigned list, or vice versa
are provided. 
Finally, you can also instruct the AIMMS project to solve the problem and provide
you with a (near) optimal solution for the problem.
</p>

<p>As a planner, in the details of a flight (which can be viewed by double-clicking
	on a flight), you also have the option to ensure a flight MUST be assigned. This means
	that in case there are not enough gates to accommodate all flights, such flights will
be assigned to the gates, while other flights are left on the unassigned list.</p>

<p>Similarly, you also have the option to keep a flight completely out of the problem, by 
	designating it as "Keep flight unassigned". This will allow you to solve the problem as 
	if that particular flight is not part of the problem.
