Nonlinear Presolve Algorithm in AIMMS
========================================

This paper describes the AIMMS presolve algorithm for nonlinear problems. This presolve algorithm uses standard techniques like removing singleton rows, deleting fixed variables and redundant constraints, and tightening variable bounds by using linear constraints. Our algorithm also uses the expression tree of nonlinear constraints to tighten variable bounds.
