    The model has 21 variables and 57 constraints
    with 221 Jacobian elements, 200 of which are nonlinear.
    The Hessian of the Lagrangian has 20 elements on the diagonal,
    190 elements below the diagonal, and 20 nonlinear variables.
 
 ** Warning **  The variance of the derivatives in the initial
                point is large (= 4.6 ). A better initial
                point, a better scaling, or better bounds on the
                variables will probably help the optimization.
 
 
 ** Optimal solution. Reduced gradient less than tolerance.
