This article explains how to install an AIMMS Developer license for a **named** single user.

Prerequisite:

Install AIMMS (downloads of AIMMS can be found on our `Downloads <https://www.aimms.com/support/downloads/>`_ page).

To install the license:

#. Start AIMMS.

#. If no license is installed, a dialog will open automatically. If you previously installed a license, use the menu *Tools > License > License Configuration* and click *Install License* to specify a new license.

#. Select *Install a Single User AIMMS License* and click *Next*.

#. Enter your License Number (given in the email you received from AIMMS Licensing) and click *Next*.

#. Select *I have received an activation code* and click *Next*.

#. Copy and paste your Activation Code (given in the email you received from AIMMS Licensing) and click *Next*.

#. Select *Personal Nodelock* and click *Next*.

#. Click *Finish*.

Your new license is installed.

If you previously installed another license, move the **new license** to the top with the *Move Up* button and tick the checkbox. The next time you start up AIMMS this license will be used.

In case of any problems during installation, activation, or running AIMMS, please contact `AIMMS Support <mailto:support@aimms.com>`_.
