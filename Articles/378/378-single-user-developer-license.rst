This article explains how to install an AIMMS Developer license for a **named** single user.

To use the license:

1. Install AIMMS (downloads of AIMMS can be found at https://www.aimms.com/support/downloads/).

2. Start up AIMMS

3. If no license has been specified, a dialog will open automatically, if you already have another license running for AIMMS, you should use the menu Tools > License > License Configuration… and click "Install License…" to specify a new license.

4. Select "Install a Single User AIMMS License" and click "Next"

5. Type the license number as specified in the email you received from AIMMS Licensing, and click Next

6. Select "I have received an activation code ..." and click "Next"

7. Copy and Paste the Activation Code as specified in the email you received from AIMMS Licensing, and click Next

8. Select Personal Nodelock and click Next

9. Click Finish

10. If you already have another license specified, move the new license to the top with the "Move Up" button and make sure the checkbox at the beginning of the item is checked. The next time you start up AIMMS this license will be used.
