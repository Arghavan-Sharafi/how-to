A very useful setting that you can change is the way different types of identifiers are displayed in the editor. For example, in the picture below shows that the variable Assignments in the editor is displayed using a green color. Note that all identifiers of the type variable will have this same green color. Using different colors for different types of identifiers (combined with descriptive names) helps you to quickly understand a definition for example... figure:: images/variables_in_green.png
    Display variables in greenYou can change these editor settings by going to Editor Settings in the menu Settings. This will open the window displayed below:

After selecting a type of identifier from the list on the left, you can change the way this type of identifier should be displayed by modifying the settings on the right.
As you can see, it is even possible to display certain types of identifiers in bold-face, italic, or underlined.
Note that by selecting AIMMS in the Style Type drop down, you can also change the way comments, keywords, etc are displayed. For example, you can change that instead of the default color green, any other color should be used when displaying comments.The editor settings used for creating the screen shots of the new How To articles and the User Support training materials can be downloaded :download:`here <images/EditorSettingsCommunity.xml>`.
