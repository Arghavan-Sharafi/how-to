In the integrated environment, or on a Linux system, you can control an AIMMS project externally using a command line tool.

To start using the command line tool open the terminal and run ``AimmsCmd ExampleProject.aimms``.

.. note::
    
    If ``AimmsCmd`` program is not part of your environnement variables, you may find ``AimmsCmd`` in 
    
    ``C:\Users\<Your_User_Name>\AppData\Local\AIMMS\IFA\Aimms\<AIMMS_version>\Bin\AimmsCmd.exe``

Basic commands available
------------------------
AIMMS command line tool offers a the following commands.

* Assigning values:

    .. code-block:: none

        Let p_Demand := 100;

* Displaying the contents:

    .. code-block:: none

        Display p_Revenue;
 
* Running procedures:

    .. code-block:: none

        Run MainExecution;
        
* Exiting the tool

    .. code-block:: none

        Quit;
        
Running batch commands
----------------------
Instead of running each command one by one, you can also run batch commands by writing all the commands you want to execute in a text file. 

For example, let's say the file ``cmds.txt`` contains the following code.

.. code-block:: none
    :linenos:

    Let p_Demand := 100;
    Display p_Revenue;
    Run MainExecution;
    Quit ;

You can run the following command in the terminal to execute all the commands contained in the file.

.. code-block:: none
    :linenos:

    AimmsCmd ExampleProject.aimms < cmds.txt 

By doing this, all the running results will be displayed on the command window. If you want to redirect the output to a text file, you canÂ add it to the running command as well.

.. code-block:: none
    :linenos:

    AimmsCmd ExampleProject.aimms < cmds.txt > log.txt 
    
.. note:: Windows powershell doesn't support the ``<`` operator to redirect input. You can get around that using:

    .. code-block:: none
        :linenos:

        Get-Content cmds.txt | AimmsCmd.exe ExampleProject.aimms > log.txt
