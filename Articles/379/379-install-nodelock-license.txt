This article explains how to install an AIMMS Developer license for a single user **with a nodelock**.

Prerequisite:

Install AIMMS (downloads of AIMMS can be found on our `Downloads <https://www.aimms.com/support/downloads/>`_ page).

To install the nodelock license:

#. Start AIMMS.

#. If no license is installed, a dialog will open automatically. If you previously installed a license, use the menu *Tools > License > License Configuration* and click *Install License* to specify a new license.

#. Select *Install a Single User AIMMS License* and click *Next*.

#. Enter your License Number (given in the email you received from AIMMS Licensing) and click *Next*.

#. Select *I have received an activation code* and click *Next*.

#. Copy and paste your Activation Code (given in the email you received from AIMMS Licensing) click *Next*.

#. Select *Personal Nodelock* and click *Next* (unless you are sure you want a machine nodelock - see the notes regarding Nodelocks below).

#. Click *Finish*.

Your new license is installed.

If you previously installed another license, move the **new license** to the top with the *Move Up* button and tick the checkbox. The next time you start up AIMMS this license will be used.

In case of any problems during the installation, activation, or running of AIMMS, please contact `AIMMS Support <mailto:support@aimms.com>`_.

.. topic:: Nodelocks

   You have the choice to request a personal nodelock or a machine nodelock.

   A personal nodelock must be requested online, a machine nodelock can be
   requested online or offline.

   Personal nodelocks are intended for use by a single AIMMS user, who still
   wishes to have the freedom to use AIMMS on multiple computers.

   Machine nodelocks are intended for permanent use on a single computer. They
   are recommended for server applications, and can also be used for personal
   use if you are sure you will be using Aimms on a single computer, or do not
   have internet access.

   You can switch your personal nodelock to a machine nodelock at any
   time.

   For more information, see the `AIMMS Users' Guide <https://documentation.aimms.com/aimms_user.html>`_ (section 2.6.1).
