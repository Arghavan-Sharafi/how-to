One of the features in the 2D chart page object that is not very well-known is that the end-user can actually change the view of the chart (e.g. scaling or moving)
#. Scale the chart by pressing CTRL, holding down both mouse buttons. Then move the mouse up to increase the size of the chart or move the mouse down to decrease the size of the chart.
#. Move the chart by pressing SHIFT and, while holding both mouse buttons down, moving the mouse.
#. Zoom to an area in the chart by using CTRL and the left mouse button. Drag the mouse to pick the area to zoom on.
#. Rotate the chart by holding both mouse buttons and moving the mouse up or down. Note: this will no yield an effect in every chart type.
Perhaps the most important of these features is that you can reset the
view to the original by pressing the 'r' key on your keyboard.
