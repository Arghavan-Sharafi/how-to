AIMMS started life as a desktop product. Users were mostly individually responsible for looking after their applications, managing the changes, making back-ups, etc. Unwanted incidents such as bugs, accidental project deletion and hardware failures usually had a very limited local impact. Of course mission-critical AIMMS applications were already managed more rigorously.
The advent of AIMMS PRO is introducing new application management challenges as many more users and/or business operations potentially depend on a single PRO platform for performing their tasks. We see our clients looking for ways to professionally operating their PRO platforms. Purpose of this blog post is to provide you with some aspects to consider in this context. We are not proposing anything novel, but merely pointing out some common practices of application management.
Goal-----------
We believe it is fair to assume that your goal in operating your AIMMS PRO platform can be broadly described as ‘maximize uptime AND facilitate rapid innovation’.
The two most likely uptime disruptions are software updates and ‘disasters’. ‘Disasters’ typically are hardware failures and human errors such as accidental file deletes. In the AIMMS PRO context ‘software updates’ fall into two categories: underlying software updates and new or updated apps. In the following paragraphs we will propose some basic practices for avoiding resp. dealing with both disruption causes.
Operate a Test-environment----------------------------------------
All larger IT applications operate change procedures and test and/or acceptance environments in addition to their production installation in order to prevent disruptions to their users and operations from changes and updates. Typically the test environment serves to test changes before these are applied in production. The acceptance environment is used for testing the migration to the production environment. For less critical applications, the acceptance environment is often left out.
Best practices in this field are well documented and can be obtained from any IT Operations team. Typical aspects to consider include testing, approval, authorization, announcements and roll-back.
We recommend you to operate at least an AIMMS PRO test environment that closely resembles your production installation, i.e. same PRO and PRO-Package versions and similar or the same data sources , same operating system, same hardware (maybe less powerful). In mission-critical applications we recommend adding an acceptance environment, closely matching your production installation, solely for testing/practicing your updates prior to updating production environments.
If your AIMMS applications connect to other systems, you need to decide whether to connect your AIMMS PRO test environment to the production installations of these systems or to the test environments. The choice is of course very dependent on your specific situation, but rigorous testing can probably work well with input data from production systems, but results are probably best written to a test system.
For AIMMS PRO we can identify two types of changes that require testing prior to production deployment:
#. New or updated AIMMS PRO applications; even though PRO enables instant global release of new or updated applications, one should test these thoroughly before publication.
#. Changes, updates, patches, etc. to the underlying software such as the AIMMS software, the operating system, virtualization software, etc. can cause disruptions to the proper functioning of the optimization platform and the optimization applications. So these changes need to be tested prior to applying them for the production environment.</li>
Consider operating a Maintenance Window-------------------------------------------

If your AIMMS PRO installation is used by large numbers of app developers and end users, you may want to operate a Maintenance Window. This is a fixed time window, e.g. each Monday 20:00-0:00, in which the production system may be taken down for software updates and other maintenance. Users can then plan for this.
Consider using a Version Control System---------------------------------------
With the launch of AIMMS 4 the entire model is saved in text files and can thus be stored in a version control system. This has numerous advantages:
#. The entire ‘history’ of a model remains available and one can always roll-back to earlier versions or differentiate between proven production version and development versions with new functionality.
#. Multiple developers can work effectively and reliably on one model simultaneously, with branching and merging to ensure everybody can work effectively and proven changes can be shared and deployed easily.
We recommend the use of a distributed VCS like Git. With Git you can have the entire repository on your local machine, commits are initially just stored locally, and you can branch and merge locally without making those branches public in whatever way. This part of it, really, is just a matter of installing the Git-related software and starting to use it.
To be able to share, Git also supports the capability to pull /push some or all branches to a repository on a central machine. If other people also pushed to the branch(es) you are pushing to, you first have to pull in those commits, after which merging (and possibly conflict resolution) takes place locally, and you can push the merged branch back to the central repo. As far as needing the infrastructure for this: this would be something where your IT comes in (and to make it easy: there are virtual appliances that set up a central Git server with authentication and authorization). Alternatively, there are companies like Atlassian, Github, Assembla, … which offer hosted solutions where you get the possibility to have your private repositories hosted in the cloud, with integrated issue tracker support (where issues can be linked to commits and vice versa).

Disaster Recovery------------------

Depending on the nature of your PRO applications you need to take appropriate measures to deal with ‘disasters’ such as server, disk or connection failure. It is best to refer to you IT department for appropriate solutions. Some issues to consider:
#. Recovery of accidentally deleted AIMMS projects: app developers may accidentally delete their project files. We believe that the use of a version control system, such as Git, is the best ‘first-line-of-defense’ against this. Use of automated daily or even more frequent back-ups is an alternative.
#. Recovery from disk failure: this is typically handled by restoring a back-up. The amount of work lost will depend on the back-up interval. Distributed version control systems like Git are an alternative to be resilient against disk failures.
#. Recovery from server failure: this is typically done with back-up servers, ‘hot standby’ or ‘cold standby’. The recovery times will depend on equipment and procedures. In addition the new PRO ‘scale-out’ functions may already offer resilience against server failure as any machine in the PRO cluster can take on the job management automatically.
#. Recovery from data-center incidents such as fire: this is dealt with by having multiple data centers, again either ‘hot standby’ or ‘cold standby’ or even ‘mirrored’.
There is obviously a trade-off between the level of resilience and time required to recover from a disaster and costs. Each business will have to make its own trade-offs here.
To conclude...-----------------------

As AIMMS applications move from desktops to PRO platforms and start to play a larger role for a larger number of users it is important to adopt the best practices that the IT specialists have developed for operating server-based business applications. We have listed a few of them, mainly with the purpose to raise awareness. We do not claim to be experts on this topic and we encourage you to connect with those specialists and their best practices to ensure that your AIMMS PRO project becomes and remains successful... include:: /includes/form.def
