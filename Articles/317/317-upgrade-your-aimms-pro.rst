Upgrade an AIMMS PRO installation
=================================

The AIMMS PRO upgrade process is designed to be easy, please use the installer available from `here <https://www.aimms.com/english/developers/downloads/download-aimms-pro/>`_.

Before you start, however, please take care of the following notes:

#.  From AIMMS PRO 2.28 onwards, the Universal Runtime is needed. 
    Windows 10 comes with this runtime pre-installed, but this is not true for all Windows versions, installations. 
    As there are different ways in use to check whether the Universal Runtime is installed, the Universal Runtime is no longer part of AIMMS PRO installers.
    To manually install the Universal Runtime on the machine that hosts AIMMS PRO, 
    please follow the instructions from `Microsoft <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3118401/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows>`_ .
