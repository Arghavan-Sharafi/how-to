AIMMS Outer Approximation Algorithm for MINLP (using GMP functionality)
==========================================================================

This document describes how to use the GMP variant of the AIMMS Outer Approximation (AOA) algorithm for solving MINLP problems. We show how the AOA algorithm can be combined with the nonlinear presolver and the multi-start algorithm.
