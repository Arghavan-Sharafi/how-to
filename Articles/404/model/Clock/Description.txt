In this example a clock is created. This clock is drawn in a network object (with the old AIMMS logo) and is updated every second. 

To perform this update we use the function ScheduleAt. This function can be used to run a specific procedure at a specific moment in time.

If you want to run a procedure at regular intervals, as we have done, then you can re-schedule the procedure from within the scheduled procedure itself.
