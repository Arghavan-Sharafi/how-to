.. figure:: images/index.jpg    Multiple indices for a set    One question that I have seen multiple times being asked to our support via email, as well as on the AIMMS Google Group is a way to use different indices to refer to the elements of a set.
Suppose we have a set Cities, then a parameter Distance would naturally be defined over 2 dimensions (from and to), both coming from this same set Cities. However, if you don't know that AIMMS can handle multiple indices for a set, a solution approach I have seen come by a couple of times is creating two new sets CitiesFrom and CitiesTo, both subset of the set Cities, containing all elements of the set Cities and each with its' own index.

If you create a new set, you can directly add multiple indices to this set by typing all of them in the index attribute field, separated by commas (e.g. ``city, cityFrom, cityTo``). The only thing is that after the initial assignment of one or more indices to the index attribute of a set, you can't type in the index attribute of a set anymore.
In the screenshot on the right, the index city was added, after which the 'Check, Commit, and Close' button was pressed. When the attribute window for this set is now opened, you will see that the index attribute is grayed out indicating it is not possible to type in this attribute anymore.
If you want to modify the indices for this set Cities now, you will have to make use of the index attribute wizard, which you can open by pressing the magic wand button just left of the input field for the index attribute. This will then open the wizard for the index attribute, which is shown below:

Note that an alternative way is to manually add an index identifier to your model tree for each index you want to add. For these index identifiers, you will have to set the Range attribute to the set that this index should correspond to as shown in the image below: .. figure:: images/demo-explicit-index.png    Explicit index identifier for set
