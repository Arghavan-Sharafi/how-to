After reporting an incident and analyzing the associated log files, further analysis may be needed. If the incident is reproducible, then we may want to have more detailed information of what happens. One way to obtain such information is by creating more logging information which is discussed in this article.

This article provides three files that are templates in creating this information:

#. ``LoggerConfig.xml`` This is the most important file

#. ``pro_arguments.txt``

#. ``RunWithExtraLogging.bat``
