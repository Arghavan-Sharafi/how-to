When you want to share some information about your model, you typically want to direct another person to take a look at specific lines in a procedure or a definition. In order to do this, you will need to know the specific line number. By default, the editor in the IDE of AIMMS will not show any line numbers in attributes that can be multi-line. 

You can enable the display of line numbers in the editor settings, which you can access via Editor Settings... under the Settings menu. If you goto the Misc tab, you will see the following options:.. figure:: images/IDE-editor-settings.png    AIMMS IDE Editor settingsBy changing the value for the setting LineNumberMargin to True, AIMMS will display the line numbers for all the attributes that can consist of multiple lines. The result will look like the image below:.. figure:: images/multiline-attribute-field-with-linenumbers.png    Line numbers displayed in multiple line attributeAfter you have received a line number that is interesting, you can jump to a specific line number quickly by pressing the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+g. This will open the dialog depicted below... figure:: images/jump-to-line.png    Jump to specific line number by pressing Ctrl+gAlternatively, you can open the same dialog via Goto Line... under the Edit menu.
Note that this Goto line function works regardless of whether the line numbers are displayed or not.
