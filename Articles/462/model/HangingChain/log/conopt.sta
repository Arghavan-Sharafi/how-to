    The model has 403 variables and 204 constraints
    with 1406 Jacobian elements, 603 of which are nonlinear.
    The Hessian of the Lagrangian has 201 elements on the diagonal,
    201 elements below the diagonal, and 402 nonlinear variables.
 
 ** Warning **  The number of nonlinear derivatives equal to zero
                in the initial point is large (= 28 percent).
                A better initial point will probably help the
                optimization.
 
 
 ** Warning **  The variance of the derivatives in the initial
                point is large (= 4.5 ). A better initial
                point, a better scaling, or better bounds on the
                variables will probably help the optimization.
 
 
 ** Optimal solution. Reduced gradient less than tolerance.
