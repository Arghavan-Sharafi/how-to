    The model has 12 variables and 5 constraints
    with 37 Jacobian elements, 11 of which are nonlinear.
    The Hessian of the Lagrangian has 11 elements on the diagonal,
    10 elements below the diagonal, and 11 nonlinear variables.
 
 ** Optimal solution. Reduced gradient less than tolerance.
