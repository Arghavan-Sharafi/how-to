Attempting Connect with License Server starting WinUI application
=================================================================

Diagnosis
---------

When you start a WinUI application from AIMMS PRO, you may get the dialog:

.. image:: images/AttemptingReconnect.jpg
    :align: center

When you scan the log file 

Explanation
-------------

Some certificates uses are expired and older AIMMS and AIMMS PRO implementations are not robust against this eventuality.  

Solution
---------

There are actually two solutions:

Quickly remove the symptom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that you have valid certificates, otherwise you couldn't open the browser in a safe manner, see the following picture:

You can use the Internet Explorer to remove expired certificates. You will need to start Internet Explorer with elevated rights.
#.  cog wheel - internet options
#.  Tab content
#.  Button Certificates
#.  Tab Trusted Root Certificates
#.  Order on Expiration date
#.  For every expired certificate, press remove button.

When you want to limit the number of removed expired tickets, just remove those that have a name that corresponds to one of the tickets on the valid certificate path shown above.

Structurally remedy the problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This problem is fixed in AIMMS PRO 2.31 and newer, and in AIMMS 4.68 and newer.  
By using these or newer versions of AIMMS and AIMMS PRO, the problem is structurally solved.

AIMMS advises to keep using the most recent version of AIMMS, but only upgrade your application after sufficiently testing it.
